# IdealGas-Vs-VanDerWaal

 Description : The ideal gas was developed during 17th and 18th centry by a group of scientists. They were inspired and had a desire to understand nature 
 and a quest to make balloons in which they could fly and also the get the relationships  between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is, 
 pressure, volume,temperature, and amount of gas. Although, the eqution (P*V=n*RT) applies only as an approximation to a real gas that behaves sufficiently 
 like an ideal gas. There are in fact many different forms of the equation of state. Since the ideal gas law neglects both molecular size and inter molecular   
  attractions, it is most accurate for monatomic gases at high temperatures and low pressures. The neglect of molecular size becomes less important for lower 
  densities, for larger volumes at lower pressures, because the average distance between adjacent molecules becomes much larger than the molecular size. The 
  relative importance of intermolecular attractions diminishes with increasing thermal kinetic energy, with increasing temperatures. More detailed equations of 
  state, such as the van der Waals equation, account for deviations from ideality caused by molecular size and intermolecular forces.This program will conduct an 
  experimeint between the ideal gas equation andthe van der Waals equation. To do so will take 5 different gas and compare the pressure as the temperature increase 
  from 100 to 500 degrees kalvin. Will then take the differance between the ideal gas and van der waals and divide by van der waals and mlutiply by 100 precent to 
  get the precent error. As temperature rises the precent error would dcrease due to the as that intermolecular attractions.
